# Who am I?

[👋🏻] I am Grégoire GIBRAT, and I come from Toulouse, France.

[❤️] I love learning more about the tech world (both software and hardware), programming, traveling around the world, and walking.

[🗣️] I speak French (native language) and English (B2 level). I’m also practicing Spanish and Japanese.

# What do I do?

[🔭] I am a first-year IT student at the University of Paul Sabatier in Toulouse.

[🌱] I work with programming languages such as C, C++, Python, and Ada.

[⚡] My projects:

FightGame [IN PROGRESS]: A mini game in C++ that features a turn-based fantasy fight.

SnakeCut [PLANNED]: An open-source application that can split a file into two parts, encrypt the data, and the file can only be read if both parts are put back together.
